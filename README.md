TODO: Add desc of how to use app and where to put audio files

The music folder should be found in the Files App named "SPEQ_Music"

This is where you will add your folders with your music. Please follow the following format:
SPEQ_Music/AlbumName/song.mp3

Example path for my simulator:
/Users/Xcode/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/F00BCDBA-B55E-4D29-A141-2D00D0544339/data/Containers/Data/Application/8E7C5B16-C271-4C59-9177-E3AAB10FC31E/Documents/SPEQ_Music/
