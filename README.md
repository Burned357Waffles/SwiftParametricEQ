The music folder should be found in the Files App named "SPEQ_Music"

This is where you will add your folders with your music. Please follow the following format:
SPEQ_Music/AlbumName/song.mp3

Example path for my simulator:
/Users/Xcode/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/F00BCDBA-B55E-4D29-A141-2D00D0544339/data/Containers/Data/Application/8E7C5B16-C271-4C59-9177-E3AAB10FC31E/Documents/SPEQ_Music/

If you run this in Xcode the path will be printed out so you can find it.

In the documents folder of the app, there will be a json named "eq_profile.json" which will store the values of all your EQ filters. If it is not already there, it can be created in the app.
